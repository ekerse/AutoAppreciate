12/14/2021 8:38:49	nlroth@umich.edu	hobbes@umich.edu	I have very much appreciated Steve's help in reviewing and getting a site license for Camtasia. It looks like we are on track to have it all set - and it couldn't have been done without him. Thanks Steve! 		x
12/14/2021 8:40:38	nlroth@umich.edu	scurring@umich.edu	Scott has been working very hard to get the Shure microphones replaced in all the CoE classrooms for Winter. I am not sure any of us thought it would be able to be done between getting the equipment, room availability, and the effort. But because of Scott's great organizational skills and thoughtfulness - it looks like it is on a good path. Thank you Scott!		x
12/14/2021 15:58:51	nlroth@umich.edu	tknox@umich.edu	Tom did a great job at his IT Symposium talk. Thank you for all the time and effort you put into this. I am very hopeful it will lead to many campus collaborations. 		x
12/17/2021 8:07:21	eckmeter@umich.edu	pomeroye@umich.edu	Although it's definitely Elzie's job, I heard a lot of positive feedback on his coverage of NAME of the past four days while I was out sick. Reading through his ticket comments, he's very thorough and has excellent customer service skills, and was able to resolve all issues while I was out. I really appreciate having him able to slide in and keep things going at NAME in my absence!		x

No only did he help me figure out that the iPad wasn't working after trying many times and different ways he also offered to use his own phone to load the photos onto the Panono site for us. And if that wasn't enough Parker renamed all of the photos (60+) and figured out what room belonged to each image. Thank you Parker for taking the time out of your day to sit down and help me through the problem and make sure that it was completely resolved and the process finished correctly!		x
1/18/2022 15:36:37	jkieft@umich.edu	mcgrealk@umich.edu	Katia took on the daunting task to help clean out and organize the supply closet in the CAEN admin suite.

2/9/2022 12:40:00	nlroth@umich.edu	millerlo@umich.edu	Lois's help on getting the EITC website all set up. Not only has she been managing the students doing daily updates, she has gone above and beyond to review the content, suggest changes and improvement and just making the site better for everyone. One person told me "I LOVE a conference organized by IT types - so easy to navigate, register, calendar it, etc!" This is in large part due to Lois's effort. 		x
2/9/2022 12:53:28	kssaito@umich.edu	gblichar@umich.edu	George showed up for his first day today and jumped right in!  Welcome and we're glad to have you.	tongsun@umich.edu	x
2/10/2022 13:57:40	danm@umich.edu	dparkin@umich.edu, pomeroye@umich.edu	The College had a very important NSF virtual site visit for a research center that David and Elzie provided IT support for.  This required multiple day long meetings and run throughs that started back in November and ended in early February.  Both David and Elzie did a great job working with the team and making sure we had redundant IT solutions in place should something have gone wrong.  I've received many complements from individuals involved in the session about the support and professionalism of David and Elzie throughout the process.  By all accounts the virtual visit was a huge success and their contributions helped make it so.  Fantastic work both of you!		x
2/10/2022 15:54:14	stormy@umich.edu	millerlo@umich.edu	I've been out for a couple days, and Lois has been keeping the ship afloat -- moderating email lists, keeping our web team students busy, and handling the web publishing queue like a boss. Just wanted to let her know I appreciate her efforts in my absence.		x
2/10/2022 16:51:06	tknox@umich.edu	mmarroqu@umich.edu	For unreasonably good cheer in the face of utter chaos, and for generally making us all look good!  We closed an offer for an open position today, and it never would have happened without Melani being on top of all the details, logistics, communications, and HR requirements.  I'm not gonna lie, hiring is really difficult and I kinda hate it, but Melani sure makes it a whole lot easier.		x

But in particular recently she helped me resolve an issue we were having with a certain someone (who will remain unnamed) trying to reserve a CAEN Lab that was not available. I had tried to reach out to this person and offer different options and asked if we could make a compromise. When my attempts had failed I reached out to Chevette for help and she was able to find a solution that was agreed upon and made everyone happy.

We needed to have final numbers first thing in the morning to pass on to upper management. So I reached out to Debi before she was even due to start working that day and contacted her in various methods so that she would see it as soon as she starting working that morning. Debi went above and beyond realizing the urgency and got back to me before she was even scheduled to start working. She hopped on a zoom call with me right away and we figured out the final numbers together.   John and I were so appreciative for Debi's quick response and willingness to help us solve the problem right away.

3/29/2022 9:14:42	jkieft@umich.edu	jparisea@umich.edu	We needed to place a large order with an international company who was no longer a supplier in our system for an iPad building project. Because the total dollar amount was over my P-Card limit we had to re-set up an account with the supplier. This ended up being quite a process and we had some bumps along the way.   Luckily John helped me with this process from the very beginning. Starting by getting a quote from the supplier, reaching out to the supplier representative and making sure we got everything sorted out before our discount expired.  This was a big undertaking. Especially on top of everything else that was going on at the same time. I am so appreciative that John took the initiative and helped me to be able to complete this important order. I couldn't have done it without all your help! Thank you very much!!!		x

After panicking a little Steve ended up responding to my cry for help and fit me in in-between his meetings that morning. I really appreciate that you took to time to address my last minute needs and did so even with a busy schedule of your own. Thank you very much!  Also I've been able to reserve this room for other things since then. So I'm very grateful that you were able to make the changes to my 25live access. Thanks again!		x

4/7/2022 8:17:35	louissd@umich.edu	kevinmcl@umich.edu	During meeting the security team was having with unit staff about the NGFW one of the staff members was very disppointed on how things had been done in the past.  This had a strong effect on his attitude.    It was a difficult conversation but Kevin handled it very diplomatically, he used active listening and presented solutions and suggestions that moved the process forward in a way that will benefit both the unit and CoE as a whole.  It helps that he is so knowledgeable about the firewall and has had years of experience but the strongest skill that he demonstrated was his handling of the concerns that were raised while not responding to the the generally negative feelings.    		x
4/13/2022 10:27:02	kssaito@umich.edu	delgas@umich.edu	For putting together a thoughtful, engaging email to the CAEN staff outlining the crucial work he does for CAEN and our students year after year.		x

You have done this multiple times which have included other peoples orders as well. I have also appreciated you letting me know when there is an easy in stock item that you are able to just go pick up right away so that I don't always have to put through the order online.  All this to say I'm very grateful for all your help with the Tech Shop orders recently! Thank you very much!		x
4/19/2022 9:07:48	jkieft@umich.edu	mcgrealk@umich.edu	Thank you Katia for all your help picking up the multiple Tech Shop orders recently. Not only were there multiple Tech Shop orders for you to pick up at once but they were also 4+ items in each order which included large heavier packages. To the point where you had to use a cart and make multiple trips back and forth.   I know it was a bigger undertaking than normal Tech Shop pick ups and yet you were still happy to help.   Thank you very much! Myself as well as Aaron really appreciated this!		x
4/19/2022 14:43:21	jkieft@umich.edu	chevette@umich.edu	Chevette has helped me so much with 25live scheduling recently. There were actually multiple things that came up lately that Chevette was there helping me with.  One of the bigger undertakings was trying to figure out who can use which CAEN Lab this spring/summer. There were multiple summer programs/camps interested in the same rooms and so it was quite a task trying to find a good compromise so that everyone was happy. This did mean that I had to move people around a bit though.  Chevette really helped me to figure out what the needs actually were and what options we had. This got to be a little overwhelming for me but Chevette was so calm about the situation and made me feel as though everything would work out smoothly.   I don't know if you realize how much help you were during this process but I really appreciated it! There was a point where I was really struggling and was having a rough time because of it but because of you I was able to calm down and get through it and move on. Thanks you very much for your help and all that you do!!!		x

Karen graciously offered to train us on how to use Teamworks and walked us through all the features it has to offer. She even scheduled more than one session to help accommodate each of our schedules.

Lois was integral to the success of the site launch - from overseeing the day-to-day hands-on work our students put in, to creating documents to keep the process organized, Lois put more into this migration than the average migration requires. The end result of Lois' teamwork and efforts was a very successful launch of a site with over 130 posts and pages. Both Mike Africa and Chris Barr have stated in various channels how pleased they are with the site and they've been proud to share it, stating it will be a great resource for their faculty.

The food was delivered to us at the event location which left us having to transport the drinks and supplies that went along with that.

Even at the expense of yourself which I did not know about until later in the day.

Thank you Sarah for all that you do! I really appreciate it!		x
7/11/2022 11:45:41	jkieft@umich.edu	mmarroqu@umich.edu	Because Melani will be out on maternity leave soon she scheduled a time for us to get together and go over everything that I will need to know. She walked me through the actual process with a new student hire and answered all of my questions that I had. I really appreciated Melani taking the time to make sure I understood everything and felt comfortable with it. Thank you very much Melani!		x

7/19/2022 10:39:31	stormy@umich.edu	mnwong@umich.edu	Twice now, while I've been on vacation, the folks in Chemical Engineering have reached out to extend the deadline for the Faculty Activity Report system. Both times, Michele responded quickly and took care of them, even though it is not her department (which is Mechanical). I feel lucky to be part of such a great cross-departmental team, and am appreciative of Michele's efforts -- thanks for having my back!		x

7/22/2022 14:54:50	nlroth@umich.edu	elama@umich.edu	Aaron is just on top of things. He is thinking steps ahead, big on collaboration, and when I say what about... he usually has already done it. Thank you Aaron for your excellent work for the College. 		x
7/26/2022 10:26:33	nlroth@umich.edu	tplomari@umich.edu	Tabbatha has been doing a great job representing Engineering at the Wolverine Web Services RFP demos. She has asked thoughtful questions and her input will be critical to Engineering's recommendation for other vendors. This is her first time through this large and complicated process and she has been doing a great job. 		x
7/26/2022 11:15:36	millerlo@umich.edu	jkieft@umich.edu	I came over to the Admin suite looking for a jacket, etc. as the building was VERY cold Monday 7/25 morning (and all day). Jessica and I found nothing at the time, but later a perfectly sized blanket and a space heater were found and delivered to our office - by Jessica. Very much appreciated; she made all the difference in me staying (and working comfortably). Thank you, Jessica!		x
7/26/2022 13:10:59	tknox@umich.edu	jelkhati@umich.edu	Jad has - more than once - dropped everything to help debug and resolve a problem wiht the Performance Reviews.  He always produces an on-point pull request explaining what was wrong and how he fixed it.  More like this please!		x
7/26/2022 13:15:17	tknox@umich.edu	eckmeter@umich.edu	If I looked up "going the extra mile" I would not be surprised to see a picture of Chris as part of the definition.   He has been incredibly helpful with Izzyfied Macbooks and don't even get me started on his generous sharing of drone time and wisdom.  Love so see someone enjoy their work and take so much initiative.  NAME, CAEN, and the College or lucky to have him!		x
7/28/2022 14:04:45	nlroth@umich.edu	msbolt@umich.edu	In our most recent meeting with CRLT-E the agenda notes say on it "NFO + EGSITO - Misty rocks!" . Kellie has greatly appreciated how Misty has jumped in to helping review and edit content for new faculty and graduate student instructors (especially in regards to getting started with Canvas). 		x
7/28/2022 14:40:55	msbolt@umich.edu	treib@umich.edu	Phil agreed to meet with me on very short notice (the day before his vacation no less!) so that I could learn more about the Apple TV upgrades to share in the upcoming faculty newsletter. Phil did a great job explaining the upgrades, AND he even presented the info via zoom from a classroom lectern so I could view the settings just as an instructor would! I greatly appreciate his accommodation and thoughtfulness! 		x
7/29/2022 14:00:36	eckmeter@umich.edu	tknox@umich.edu	Thank you for meeting with my researchers and I to discuss best options for managed web servers and databases!

8/2/2022 13:23:43	jkieft@umich.edu	dlambert@umich.edu	Thank you Don for all your help with ERB! I appreciate you letting me into the rooms when I didn't have a key and for letting me know when you left the room open for us to make our multiple trips over various days to bring everything over into the DC. Also I want to say thank you for all the information you provided me for the printer in the ERB. That was a huge help for me so that I was able to cancel the maintenance on it.   Thanks again! I really appreciated all your help!		x
8/2/2022 13:32:39	jkieft@umich.edu	myliciaw@umich.edu	Mya helped me clean out the ERB work room and went on multiple trips with and without me to make sure we got every little thing possible out of there. This was a huge help! This would have taken me twice as long or longer without her. She even helped me put everything away and try and find a spot to put everything here in the DC.  Thank you so much Mya for all of your help! I really really appreciated it!		x

They said Karen has gone above and beyond to help them, has been very nice and has been generous with her time in meeting with them.   The staff member's manager suggested they bring more project management into their work and they reached out to me. We identified that they could benefit from having a tool to manage tasks.  They said that their manager is very happy with the idea of using Teamwork.   Thank you , Karen.		x

8/23/2022 16:42:48	msbolt@umich.edu	elama@umich.edu	Aaron and I met twice to prepare the desired content for the Canvas handout, which was distributed at the new faculty orientation.

8/26/2022 13:01:36	danm@umich.edu	msbolt@umich.edu	Misty worked hard to put together the faculty IT newsletter that I sent out today.  We have struggled in past years to get this message out and she did an excellent job managing the process, getting everyones articles and proofreading.  We could not have done it without her!!		x
8/26/2022 13:15:41	danm@umich.edu	louissd@umich.edu, kevinmcl@umich.edu	Kevin and Louis did a great job working to filter the list of IRAP machines we need to look at across the College. ITS sent CoE a list of almost 400 computers that needed to be reviewed with a very short timeline just before the start of the term.  Kevin and Louis were able to apply some logic and leverage their experience to filter the list down to 20 systems and save the departmental IT staff a ton of work.  Great Job!		x

9/8/2022 12:29:24	stormy@umich.edu	reisj@umich.edu	Jhonathan took time out of multiple days to meet with Professor Armstrong in IOE and help get his Safety Committee Google Apps Scripts working again. The scripts are a very complicated Rube Goldberg-esque contraption that monitors Professor Armstrong's inbox for safety incident emails, parses them, appends spreadsheet attachments to a drive document, and sends mails to managers in the affected parties' departments. The code was not pretty nor easy to debug, but Jhonathan was very patient and helpful, and helped get things back in order.		x

9/12/2022 8:51:57	jkieft@umich.edu	chevette@umich.edu	Chevette has helped me so much with 25live getting things ready for the fall semester. I ran into multiple circumstances where the requestor was having a hard time making a reservation in 25live for a CAEN Lab and I reached out to Chevette to see if she could figure out what was wrong. Chevette found out that the people trying to make the request didnt have the correct access and thats why they kept getting error messages. Another huge help recently was trying to figure out where we could move ENG 151 classes that were supposed to take place in Pierpont B505 & B507. Because of a sudden flooding problem in Pierpont we had to quickly find an alternative room for these classes to use. Chevette helped me try and figure out what was available during those times right away.   Thank you so much Chevette for all your continuous help with 25live and helping me get through all the issues that arise!!! I really appreciate it!		x
9/12/2022 9:08:34	jkieft@umich.edu	jparisea@umich.edu	I ended up getting sick at one of the worst times (the start of the fall semester). This is when lecture capture gets pretty crazy and we end up with lots of requests coming in constantly. When I was finally well enough to start working again I saw my email was packed full of Lecture capture requests. But as I started to go through them I realized that they were all pretty much taken care of already. John had taken over this task while I was out and set up the lecture recordings and responded to all the tickets. I was so extremely grateful that John had taken over to make sure there wasn't a back log of tons of lecture capture requests. When I got back from being out for awhile I was so overwhelmed with try to catch up on my emails and what I had missed but the fact that I didnt have to worry about previous lecture capture request was truly a blessing and very much appreciated!  Thank you so much John for helping take over the lecture capture requests while I was gone. I know it was a lot to add to your plate as well but I want to let you know that I really appreciate it!!!		x
9/12/2022 9:25:13	jkieft@umich.edu	nlroth@umich.edu	Nikki has helped me in so many ways lately! Some of the things I am most grateful for is the help with 25live while I was out sick and taking care of anything that I wasn't able to finish up with before I left. As well as taking care of the urgent requests that came in. Also before I was out sick we were trying to transition Mya into being a student employee and I remember having a lot going on that day. You had offered to create the new hire ticket for Mya in TeamDynamix and I was so grateful and appreciative that you helped me out with that. Thank you Nikki again for all your help recently with everything I really appreciate it so much!!!		x
9/12/2022 9:36:08	jkieft@umich.edu	myliciaw@umich.edu	My first day back in the office Nikki had an event going on that she needed help with. The Friday before this event I had agreed to help out. But Monday morning we found out there was flooding in Pierpont and it became my top priority to get classes into alternative spaces for that day and the rest of the week. Unfortunately this was something really urgent that I needed to take care of and ended up taking me awhile to get everything smoothed out. So Mya graciously took on my responsibility to help Nikki out with her event in my place. This was a huge help and I was extremely grateful that Mya was willing and available to take over with the other things that were going on that day.  Thank you Mya so much for all your help!!! I really appreciated it!		x

9/26/2022 10:20:48	jkieft@umich.edu	debdault@umich.edu	Debi has helped me out so many times lately and I have really appreciated it! This includes but it not limited to when I had reached out to Debi regarding the two new shortcodes and who they were being assigned to for approvals. Debi looked into this right away for us and was able to get everything corrected shortly after. Also Debi found a really old purchase order I needed documentation for that she still had in her emails. It was no longer available in our system to access so I was extremely grateful that Debi had hung onto this information from so long ago. I wouldn't have been able to complete what I was working on without it.   Thank you so much Debi for all your help and for all that you do!		x
9/26/2022 10:32:48	jkieft@umich.edu	johnm@umich.edu	The other week the office was really cold again and I wasn't wearing a coat like I normally would be. I had also taken my blanket home to wash it that I had previously had stashed away in my cube. So John brought me over a heater to use so that I could stay warm. I know it may seem like a simple thing but I really appreciated it!   Thank you John for taking care of me and making sure I stay warm when the office is cold!		x
9/26/2022 13:07:41	jkieft@umich.edu	myliciaw@umich.edu	Mya recently took on a project to update all of the CAEN staff room locations in MCommunity. This was a big task to take on and was a huge help! Additionally she ended up having to do this process twice becuase I found out I had given Mya the wrong information at the start of the project. When I went to tell Mya the bad news and that it was my fault she didn't get upset, instead she immediately got to work on fixing my mistake. I am very grateful for all of Mya's help with this as well her politeness towards having to take on more work on behalf of an error that was not her fault.  Thank you Mya for always being such an amazing part of our team and going above and beyond! I really appreciate all your hard work!		x
9/27/2022 10:26:30	jkieft@umich.edu	bentho@umich.edu	I received a 25live request for a CAEN Lab but in the comments they had stated that they really wanted a space in the DC to use for their student group meeting. So I reached out to Ben to help locate an available room in the DC for them to use during the days and times they requested. Ben found something available for two of the dates they needed a space for and reached out to the requestor to let them know. Ben also took the lead on adjusting their request so that it was for a DC space instead of a CAEN Lab.   On top of that because they still needed the CAEN Lab for one of the days they had requested Ben was able to split the request so that both rooms were able to be approved for them to use. Thank you Ben for all of your help yesterday in taking the lead on this request, making the necessary changes, and figuring out the best solution to the problem. I really appreciate it!		x
9/27/2022 13:55:12	nlroth@umich.edu	reisj@umich.edu	I asked if it would be possible for the PDAT system to remember my rows per page setting so that I didn't have to keep clicking it for the work I was doing.

Derin, Mitch, Tan, and Barrett were each so focused, helpful, and hardworking and without their efforts the site would not have been done on time nor done so well. There was some troubleshooting, design tweaking, and problem solving along the way and I'm super grateful for the work these students put into this one!	tplomari@umich.edu	x

10/13/2022 18:17:03	fko@umich.edu	kevinmcl@umich.edu	I appreciate Kevin for asking about our IRAP problem server; however, even more important, following up with me and offering actionable suggestions, troubleshooting, and monitoring.

10/17/2022 12:40:23	nlroth@umich.edu	jkieft@umich.edu	When there was a mixup and Panera delivered to the wrong location - Jessica was there to help. We couldn't have gotten what we needed if it wasn't for her! THANK YOU!		x
10/18/2022 9:12:22	jkieft@umich.edu	kati@umich.edu	There was another week recently where the building was quite cold and even though I kept my coat on I was still a little chilly. So Kati comes over with one of her quilts for me to use so that I could stay warm. It really did help and I was able to feel comfortable continuing to work throughout that week in the office.    Thank you so much Kati for always being so kind and bringing out a quilt for me to use when its one of those cold office days. I have really appreciated it! :)		x
10/18/2022 9:32:29	jkieft@umich.edu	tholiday@umich.edu	We have had multiple monitors recently that were found damaged and so we needed to replace them and submit risk management claims to get reimbursed. When Tom reached out to me for each of these damaged monitors he also provided me with all the information I needed such as the serial number, product name, number, and even the PO number for the original order. This was extremely helpful because I was able to find all the documentation I needed really easily in order to submit the claim.   This made a huge difference and I am very grateful that Tom went above and beyond to provide me with all the information I could possibly need.   Thank you very much!!!		x

10/21/2022 13:37:20	rosemoya@umich.edu	maitriwh@umich.edu	I just facilitated a CiU-ABR session for the first time.  Maitri was so supportive and helpful. I was nervous going in and she provided the support I needed to stay calm(ish). She gave me helpful tips, answered all of my pre-questions, took on the entire role of handling the technical logistics during the session, etc. On top of all of that her presence in the session is magical. I look forward to facilitating more sessions with Maitri. She is an invaluable asset to Michigan Engineering and the success of this impactful DEI professional development program.		x

10/28/2022 16:03:11	jeffrich@umich.edu	oberleky@umich.edu	I was working with Kyle on getting a phone installed for the new staff member at LEC for a specialized phone set. Kyle spent a lot of time on the phone with the phone set provider who was not very helpful.

11/1/2022 14:33:01	stormy@umich.edu	millerlo@umich.edu, tplomari@umich.edu	Tabbatha and Lois have been doing a heckuva good job with all things web publishing. They have both done excellent work keeping detailed track of all sites and reforming and improving all our data collection processes, staying on top of plugin updates, accessibility, Google Analytics 4 conversions, PHP version upgrades, and so on. With new sites and site conversions pouring in all year. Lois has been leading a team of students to add ALT tags to all our web publishing sites, which will improve accessibility and compliance. Everyone has really been working together great as a team -- and the students too -- and I just wanted to acknowledge that and give overdue kudos.		x
11/3/2022 8:57:59	ttunks@umich.edu	harriszw@umich.edu	After my video conferencing unit had a hardware failure, Zach did amazing work getting my conference room back into working condition. He should be awarded multiple points for this high-quality and prompt work.		x

11/4/2022 11:57:40	fko@umich.edu	millerlo@umich.edu	Lois has spent many hours on CLaSP requests to migrate wepages to CAEN WordPress.  While one can say it is her job, i want to appreciate the attention to detail, care, quick response, and kind communication I received on these many requests.		x
11/4/2022 12:00:58	fko@umich.edu	tplomari@umich.edu	Tabbatha worked many hours on CLaSP requests to migrate wepages to CAEN WordPress.  While one can say it is her job, i want to appreciate the kind and thoughtful communication I received for these migrations.  Despite several being very outdated, Tabbatha forged ahead - we could not have done these migrations without her help.  All of the sites look AWESOME - the attention to detail and follow up are very much appreciated.		x
11/4/2022 14:01:04	tplomari@umich.edu	derinog@umich.edu	We've been working through a decently large, more than typically tricky Web Pub migration and while several folks have put in effort to get the job done, Derin really shone during this project by stepping in at the last moment to complete some very important final tasks that we needed to get done under a soon-approaching deadline. She dove in with little notice and  really cranked out her work quickly and enabled our team to finish up our end of the migration by the needed date. Her flexibility and hard work do not go unnoticed!		x
11/10/2022 14:18:59	nlroth@umich.edu	elama@umich.edu	For all his work on new quizzes. He has been participating on an ITS working group and has been a great help to them.

11/10/2022 14:23:57	nlroth@umich.edu	avaughan@umich.edu	Atisha has been very helpful with evaluating products to help with some of our web projects when she has extra time. This has allowed us to be ahead when they eventually come back, and are ready to move forward with it (for example Course Evals). 		x
11/10/2022 14:25:21	nlroth@umich.edu	tongsun@umich.edu	For her diligence figuring out why there were so many unsubscribes for email on a certain date and for working to fix it - since AAUM did it in a way that is not helpful to us.		x
11/10/2022 14:27:43	nlroth@umich.edu	rosemoya@umich.edu	Rose has been so helpful in taking over many of the projects that Karen was project managing. These are all very new to her and she has accepted the challenge and is doing a great job making sure that everyone gets what they want. I would also add someone not in the web team asked me if they could get a PM assigned to something - just because they needed someone to keep them on track and organized. It is so nice to see that people value this work. 		x
11/15/2022 12:52:28	msbolt@umich.edu	millerlo@umich.edu	Lois was more than willing to help me when I asked her for help with posting a website update. This particular type of update was new to me, so I wasn't sure how to apply the change in the correct manner. Lois wasn't sure either, but that didn't stop her. She embraced the challenge stating, "Well, let's give it a try; we can't break it!" So together we sleuthed the situation and made the update without issue. I so appreciate her "can do" attitude, and immediate attention to my request for assistance. Thank you, Lois! 		x

She left the meeting relieved and grateful.  Jason saved the day."	jthiels	x

I've been working with Rose and she gave me a few suggestions which I implemented. I updated the format of our meeting agenda, and I'm using some techniques to make sure we stay on track in meetings so we can get through our agenda. I am also working to set up Teamwork to keep track of all of the tasks we need to complete each semester.  The amount of work that goes into this course is overwhelming at times, but I can already see how Teamwork is going to benefit us so we don't forget anything. I recently got some feedback from a member of our instructional team that the techniques we are using are having a positive impact and they are pleased with the results. 		x
11/23/2022 9:44:41	nlroth@umich.edu	mmarroqu@umich.edu	Melani has been on top of updating our PM application submissions.

11/23/2022 13:55:15	markg@umich.edu	nlroth@umich.edu	It's really hard to say only one good thing about Nikki.  And I don't have room in this form to say them all.  What I appreciate most about Nikki is that I can actually count on her for when I need help in some of my work tasks!		x
11/23/2022 14:01:55	markg@umich.edu	nmilety@umich.edu	Nate is such a solid force in Application deployment, and has a great sense of large scale issues.

I really appreciate her willingness to help out right away and at a moments notice. Some examples are when an event is taking place and we need help getting drinks ready and bringing back and forth the food and supplies. Another example was when we needed the CAEN van to be cleaned out before a big trip. On top of that Melanie has been very helpful at implementing new tasks and taking the initiative to add them to the daily routine.  Thank you Melanie for all that you do! I really appreciate it!		x
12/6/2022 9:36:33	jkieft@umich.edu	debdault@umich.edu	Debi is always so helpful with any purchasing questions I may have. Whether it be something small and simple to complicated one off situations. Recently Debi was able to walk me through how to handle a return that was a little different than normal. It was an item that was DOA and it had been a long time since placing the original order. So it became more of an in depth process. Debi helped me figure out what the best way to resolve the issue was so that everything went smoothly. Also Debi recently caught a discrepancy in an order request that would have caused a complicated scenario and I am very grateful that she caught it ahead of time and let me know about it.  Thank you Debi so much for all your help! Both big and small. I'm always learning something new from you and I really appreciate that you're always there to help me out when I need it. 		x
12/6/2022 9:53:02	jkieft@umich.edu	johnm@umich.edu	This semester there have been some student groups who have been making 25Live CAEN lab reservations a little more difficult that usual. It's been a hard balance trying to stick to our rules that are set in place and also be accommodating to all the students needs. John has really helped me deal with these situations as they arise in a peaceful manner.   I really appreciate all the help, backup, and support you have given me to be able to handle these situations. It's made a big difference and has helped me gain confidence in reaching out to the correct people and asking the right follow up questions. Thank you very much!  Also thank you for supporting me to grow and continue to learn new skills. I've really appreciated the learning opportunities that you have lead me to recently. It helps me be able to discover what I do and do not enjoy and keeps me from feeling stuck. 		x

John helps me solve the problem and also teaches me how to deal with these situations in the future.

It ain't over til it's over, but we are in a very good place heading into the holiday break.  Also, they are both good eggs 🥚🥚🥚 and great team members!		x
12/23/2022 7:39:39	bakegreg@umich.edu	jrennell@umich.edu	Thank you for taking over the ticket from Mark from CEE with the Microsoft Display Adapter/firewall configuration issue while I was out yesterday afternoon.

1/12/2023 9:50:43	dkugler@umich.edu	pomeroye@umich.edu	I was forwarded the following email from Emily Hamilton, the UA at UMTRI. It talks about Elzie Pomeroy's work onboarding and offboarding staff. Both UMTRI HR and I appreciate Elzie's attention to detail and responsiveness.   "I just wanted to share, since you often meet with Dan Kugler, that Elzie is amazing.  He is so incredibly efficient and responsive to the information being sent to him.  He actually reads it and will process requests based on chronological start times.  He is such a pleasure to work with and is always willing to help.  I don't know where the gaps were before but things really are going well from my perspective since he started with us.  Just thought I would share!"		x

1/13/2023 10:30:43	nmilety@umich.edu	jcaudio@umich.edu	Jeff was swift and reliable these past few days when we integrated drivers for a new model into our SCCM environment.

Tina Truskowski also gave Atisha kudos in the same meeting, stating that Atisha's excellent presentation style helped her to present (again) at a high level the data in the final recommendations meeting with ease. 	dmero, ttruskow	x

John was quick to respond to the user's (and Help Desk's) concern, and fix the issue within minutes. John deserves recognition for this, and the dozens of other times he's responded to Live Chat messages. Very helpful to the HD. Thank You John!		x
1/20/2023 11:48:31	rosemoya@umich.edu	cstubles@umich.edu	Crystal went above and beyond with helping a student figure out how to turn in a laptop before they were leaving the country the following day. It was "after hours" and many of the CAEN staff/offices were done for the day. Crystal was very thoughtful about how to help the student turnover their equipment in a secure way. She did all of this during the first week in her new role with CAEN. Thank you, Crystal!		x
1/20/2023 12:39:50	cstubles@umich.edu	msbolt@umich.edu	Misty and I were in office when a student employee arrived after hours. He needed to turn in his laptop that day as he was leaving the country the next day. Misty was so helpful in problem solving so that the student's laptop could be secured that same day. 		x
1/23/2023 10:03:42	cstubles@umich.edu	nlroth@umich.edu	Nikki went above and beyond to help Misty and I the other day when a student employee arrived after hours to turn in his laptop.

He quickly determined it was a firewall issue (something that would've taken me much longer), and submitted a request to ITS for an update. This saved an enormous amount of time now, and will result in a great benefit to CAEN and Help Desk productivity moving forward. Thank You Justin!!		x
1/26/2023 14:43:34	elama@umich.edu	msbolt@umich.edu	Misty always finds the perfect wat to make the things I write sound and flow better for the reader.

2/13/2023 12:52:53	tholiday@umich.edu	walwan@umich.edu	Walter contacted Dell, to continue troubleshooting a lock BIOS PC. The resolution was to order a new system board. Dell sent two corrected quotes. Walter worked with Dell until the quote was completely correct.		x

2/27/2023 9:20:24	ttunks@umich.edu	jparisea@umich.edu	John was able to meet with me on short notice on Friday afternoon and provide expert guidance on resolving issues with a web app. The professor was flustered because of a rapidly approaching deadline, but we were able to resolve things in time. I would not have been able to figure this out on my own without John's help. His assistance also helped improve my own knowledge with configuring web apps and NGINX reverse proxy. Hugely appreciated!		x
2/27/2023 14:24:32	jkieft@umich.edu	housesj@umich.edu, millrobe@umich.edu	Sarah and Rob are always such a huge help and I appreciate them both very much. They  keep me updated on all the packages I order and let me know when something comes in, helping send out Dr. Duderstadt's packages, and so much more! Recently we had a very large amount of books that needed to be sent out separately to different people and we were struggling to find boxes to put them in. Not only did they send out the packages but they brought us boxes to use which was extremely appreciated.  Thank you both for all that you do!		x
2/27/2023 14:33:25	jkieft@umich.edu	jparisea@umich.edu	John P. has always been such a big help whenever a lecture capture request comes in and I'm not sure how to reply. Recently while John was off I was handling the lecture capture tickets that were coming in and some of them were requests that I hadn't handled before. So even though John was supposed to be off he responded to my emails and helped me to solve each and every ticket that I needed help with so that I was able to get back to them in a timely manner.   Additionally I want to say a big thank you to John for creating all the 3D printed snowflakes, space ships, and trees for the CAEN holiday party! They were so much fun and I was very excited to be able to take home a tree. You did an amazing job and I know it took a lot of time to do. So thank you John for all that you do!		x
2/27/2023 15:18:59	jkieft@umich.edu	nlroth@umich.edu	I know this is long overdue but I still want to make sure that it's said. Nikki was an extremely huge help through out the entire process of planning the CAEN holiday party! From deciding on a location, date, and time, all the way to setting up the venue the night of the event. I was so gratefully to have your help along the way. I couldn't have done it without you.  Thank you so much Nikki for everything!!!		x
2/27/2023 15:32:14	jkieft@umich.edu	howarthm@umich.edu	Melanie is always such a big help and I really appreciate everything she does for CAEN. Recently I was asked to order some replacement filters for the filter system in the CAEN admin suite. I had asked Melanie to help me look up some different supplier options and see what the price differences were. Not only did Melanie send me links to a couple different suppliers but she also looked into the product itself and found out we needed 3 different types of filters. She let me know where the best place to get them easily (bundled) and at a good price would be. She did all the research for me and sent me a link to the actually site that explained the type of filters needed. But Melanie didn't stop there, after the filters were ordered and received she took out the old ones and put the new ones in (which was not as easy as it may sound).   Thank you Melanie for all that you do and for going above and beyond what was asked of you!		x
2/27/2023 15:39:48	jkieft@umich.edu	walwan@umich.edu	We had to replace a part that was not normally sold separately from the item itself. So we had to reach out to the supplier and work with them to get a quote. Once the quote came in and I looked it over I noticed some things that needed to be changed. Walter was a huge help to get the changes correct and resolve the problem so that I could accurately place the order.   Thank you Walter for helping resolve the errors that were found with the supplier. You were a huge help!		x
3/1/2023 9:17:19	eckmeter@umich.edu	tstrothe@umich.edu	Thea is always incredibly helpful and fast to respond! Whether it's Linux or Icinga issues, they're always on it and happy to help, and it's very much appreciated!		x

3/3/2023 7:57:53	nlroth@umich.edu	ksd@umich.edu	Thank you so much for being such a great collaborator and partner between CRLT-E and CAEN. We have been able to do so much in the instructional space because of your great work and collaboration. It is so nice to see the melding of technology and pedagogy in the ways we are seeing it. Individually we give our faculty only part of the solution - together I think we are making a difference.

3/3/2023 7:59:44	nlroth@umich.edu	elama@umich.edu	Thank you for all your hard work! You are always so helpful with whatever new ideas I throw your way.

She also helped resurrect some of NERS custom settings because she had a draft PDF shared from the demo. The settings on our dev server had been wiped, and so her draft was the only record of how NERS wanted things set up. THANK YOU, MICHELE!		x

3/9/2023 15:23:57	nlroth@umich.edu	cstubles@umich.edu	Crystal did a great job taking a new fresh look at our project planning spreadsheet. She took into account what the group and I needed and gave it a new look. Thank you Crystal! 		x

3/13/2023 12:30:17	bsherid@umich.edu	dunnbri@umich.edu	Brian Dunn has been a huge help to me writing requirements documentation and user stories for the new Salesforce system. He helped me get answers to questions I had when I was unsure of who to approach to get the right information and he got the answers I needed.

3/13/2023 15:33:14	msbolt@umich.edu	millerlo@umich.edu	Shout out to Lois for her willingness to sleuth with me to solve a WordPress issue.

This is very refreshing to see, as a big part of our job as DS is being a sort of sales person, and I don't think that's always seen when you are further from the customer. Zach absolutely gets this and he is an incredible asset to our team. 		x

If the issue is outside his expertise, he serves as the conduit to get it solved.  He doesn't drop it and move on.     More than this, he volunteers to help.  You don't have ask him or ride him -- he sees the problems and solves them.  And no parades are needed afterwards."		x

She ensured we met with the time and space to plan ahead. She never failed to be so so responsive to whatever little thing popped up, from calling Washtenaw Dairy repeatedly to inquire about the specifics of the order or the pick-up or the drop-off, to quickly adjusting to new ideas on the day of. And this might seem like a small thing, but she had such a keen eye organizing the event, from the tables, to the food, to labeling each topping. It was a pleasure to work with her!		x

I asked Nikki if she would be willing to share about CAEN's Making a Bigger Difference Program.

Thank you for being awesome Nikki! 		x
8/23/2023 16:58:02	jschrade@umich.edu	nlroth@umich.edu	I was away from work, and Nikki stepped in to fix any issue with the live chat service connected to Slack for the Help Desk. It's was an effort that improved CAEN service all around for customers, and really helped the HD. Thank You, Nikki!		x

I was impressed at how organized their response was and timely.   With any outage of this level the dependencies and complexities of bringing multiple services up can be daunting.  He and his team demonstrated how legacy knowledge and experience has so much value.   But it was the well execution of it that was so truly impressive as well as their commitment.   Great job in doing the heavy lifting from the very beginning.		x

He quickly answered his self phone, on the Saturday of Labor Day weekend and shared the information needed.  Once it was determined that the quickest solution would be for him to return to campus he quickly made it to campus and resolved the issue and remained in the lab until IA could verify that the system was accessible through the crowdstrike console.  		x

A student asked about getting access to a lecture recording and instead of just saying ask your professor - he reached directly out to the professor to make sure they knew their lectures weren't being published. The professor didn't realize that and asked for instructions on how to fix it. Thank you John for being so great!		x
9/6/2023 15:53:06	tplomari@umich.edu	millerlo@umich.edu	It's been a whirlwind start to a semester and Lois has taken on the bulk of overseeing multiple last minute, urgent migrations that have required more time, attention, and urgency than is typical. Much of my focus has been on putting out other fires and keeping up on updates and communications for other matters, so Lois has been wrangling our student team and communications with our Web Pub users like a champ. Thanks for your awesome work on these two projects, Lois! 		x
9/7/2023 15:37:39	nlroth@umich.edu	elama@umich.edu, ksd@umich.edu	Aaron and Kellie collaborated on a Canvas workshop prior to the start of the year. We received the following glowing feedback on their work from a faculty member that attended   "Thank you for facilitating the informative session on Canvas yesterday. I learned several new features (e.g., toggling announcements, modules vs. pages, course image, name coach, and bulk grade posting, to name a few). It was also very helpful to interact with the other instructors and hear from you both about your (many) experiences in the classroom.  Kellie--I also appreciate your quick review of my fall syllabi and the heads-up re Fundamentals textbook. I saw it's on course reserve at the library, so I'll check it out sometime this year when planning the next run of my CEE course."  So I want to recognize their amazing good work, their collaborative spirit, the effort they spent on getting things coordinated and scheduled. All around a great team! 		x

9/19/2023 14:36:46	jschrade@umich.edu	stormy@umich.edu	Justin has been instrumental in troubleshooting issues with some of our access validation scripts, both in the CAEN Linux environment and Google apps script. Without his insight, we would have lost a substantial amount of time tracking down these issues. Thanks Justin!		x
9/22/2023 11:35:15	markg@umich.edu	alliebai@umich.edu	I could have probably filled out a dozen of these to date for Allie.  She is extremely efficient and proficient in her work.  It seems that all tasks and new initiatives we send to her, she quickly understands how to wrangle them.  Great work on everything!		x
9/22/2023 11:37:01	markg@umich.edu	mmarroqu@umich.edu	You name it!  Melani is fast and efficient.  She is very quick and efficient with her work. She juggles a lot of tasks and doesn't miss a beat. Great work on everything!		x
9/22/2023 11:37:33	alliebai@umich.edu	stormy@umich.edu	Thank you for all of the help with the Back to School luncheon! I couldn't have done it without you!		x
9/22/2023 11:40:31	markg@umich.edu	debdault@umich.edu	Finally getting around to filling these out for our well deserved staff.  Debi is hard working, thorough and very efficient in her work.  I never have to worry about getting accurate and timely depictions of the CAEN budget.  Great work on everything!		x
9/22/2023 11:51:22	stormy@umich.edu	alliebai@umich.edu	Thank YOU for all of the help with the Back to School luncheon! You did the hard part (for me, at least) which is working with the vendor.		x
9/27/2023 13:45:56	nlroth@umich.edu	jelkhati@umich.edu	I really appreciate Jad's willingness to jump into the AIMS project to help make progress. Jumping in mid-project is never easy - but his willingness to do so and his attention to detail - makes him a great part of the team. 		x
9/27/2023 13:48:47	nlroth@umich.edu	avaughan@umich.edu	I really appreciate Atisha's willingness to jump in and help with project work.  She has been instrumental in setting up the communications survey that has been going out (and will likely be a huge part of the team who reviews the results). I can't wait to see her process map on how to walk through different accommodation requests. This will definitely help the College in making recommendations that will assist so many. Atisha - thank you for being a great part of the team. 		x
9/27/2023 13:51:18	nlroth@umich.edu	tongsun@umich.edu	Tong has done a lot of amazing work in helping the Wilson Center get off of their old, impossible to maintain Access database and into Salesforce. This will allow more college visibility into what is going on in this area - and will just make things easier for the Wilson Center. Thank you for your great work on this! 		x
9/27/2023 13:53:56	nlroth@umich.edu	jsonk@umich.edu, mmiranda@umich.edu	Thank you for your willingness to participate in various booths and info days that we have participated in such as New Faculty Orientation. I am hopeful it has helped you make some faculty connections. We appreciate your help in educating and engaging with our faculty on HPC. 		x
10/3/2023 13:13:34	elama@umich.edu	rosemoya@umich.edu	Working with Rose work to get the Accessibility Working Group information for the CAEN Staff Meeting put together well ahead of when it was due because she keeps everything organized and on track!		x

10/4/2023 15:47:53	danm@umich.edu	nlroth@umich.edu	I was talking with Kati Bauer this morning and she said what a big help Nikki has been to Kylie Grace in various cases (DEI, Web, CAEN IT, etc).  Kati thought that Nikki should get a making a bigger difference award.  Great Job Nikki!	kati@umich.edu	x
10/4/2023 15:49:06	danm@umich.edu	amadi@umich.edu	From Pat Hammett "I just wanted to formally recognize Amadi for providing such outstanding service - especially during the challenges over the past few weeks. His responsiveness and patience have been awesome and a huge help for ISD!"  Thanks for representing CAEN so well Amadi!	phammett@umich.edu	x
10/10/2023 9:26:28	jeffrich@umich.edu	tholiday@umich.edu	Tom is always willing to jump in and help out when needed.. 		x
10/10/2023 10:32:54	jeffrich@umich.edu	tholiday@umich.edu	Tom was able to provide needed accurate documentation for the installation of the Occuspace devices for our new study space in 1695 Beyster. Without that documentation, it would have delayed getting these sensors online. 		x
10/10/2023 13:59:27	tstrothe@umich.edu	pauldast@umich.edu	Paul sorted out the remote KVM power situation to allow for a lot more flexibility with testing hardware/software configurations.		x
10/10/2023 15:33:48	cstubles@umich.edu	rosemoya@umich.edu	Rose is an amazing manager. She leads with empathy: consistently providing support while encouraging independence. Her plan to onboard me onto my new position was executed so well and I was given all of the resources (plus more) that I needed to do my job properly. She leads with understanding and it has allowed me to grow and learn professionally and personally. I appreciate her so much and am so thankful she is my supervisor. 		x
10/13/2023 14:24:38	hobbes@umich.edu	amadi@umich.edu,iisha@umich.edu,elama@umich.edu,mmarroqu@umich.edu	Amadi, Cindy, Aaron, and Melani recently participated in the hiring team interviews for the software position.
